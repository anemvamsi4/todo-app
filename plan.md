# Todo App with Daily Task Check-ins

## Project Overview
This project is a Todo App that allows users to:
1. Add daily tasks to track for a specific day.
2. Provide a description for each task.
3. Check in on tasks daily to mark progress or completion.
4. Have a user-friendly UI built with TypeScript.

## High-Level Plan

### 1. Initialize the Project
- Initialize a Git repository.
- Set up the project structure.
- Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project.

### 2. Set Up the Development Environment
- Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
- Initialize the project with `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
- Install necessary dependencies:
  - React (for UI)
  - TypeScript (for type safety)
  - Vite or Create React App (for project scaffolding)
  - Tailwind CSS or Material-UI (for styling)
  - Redux or Context API (for state management)

### 3. Design the UI
- Create wireframes for the app:
  - Home screen with a list of tasks for the day.
  - Add Task screen with fields for task name and description.
  - Task details screen to view and edit task information.
- Implement a responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### 4. Build the Backend
- Set up a simple backend using Node.js and Express.js.
- Create RESTful APIs for:
  - Adding a task.
  - Fetching tasks for a specific day.
  - Updating task details.
  - Deleting a task.
- Use a database (e.g., MongoDB or SQLite) to store tasks.

### 5. Implement the Frontend
- Set up the React app with TypeScript.
- Create components for:
  - Task list.
  - Add/Edit task form.
  - Daily check-in feature.
- Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs.

### 6. Add Daily Task Check-ins
- Implement a feature to mark tasks as complete or in progress.
- Display progress for the day (e.g., percentage of tasks completed).

### 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for the backend APIs.
- Write unit and integration tests for the frontend components.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the app works as expected.

### 8. Deployment
- Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Render).
- Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

### 9. Documentation
- Update the `README.md` with:
  - Installation instructions.
  - Usage guide.
  - API documentation.
- Add comments to the code for better maintainability.

### 10. Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their tasks.
- Implement notifications/reminders for pending tasks.
- Add analytics to track task completion trends.

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Git repository.
2. Set up the project structure and environment.
3. Begin with the UI design and backend setup.
